# Plugin Ecosystem (`src/features/plugins`)

A self-contained subsystem that lets Voyager run **plugins** — units that inject
styles / DOM changes into AI chat sites (Gemini, AI Studio, ChatGPT, Claude,
DeepSeek, …). Voyager's own features can migrate onto this over time; third parties
can ship their own plugins against the same contract.

## Two design constraints that shaped everything

1. **Chrome MV3 forbids remotely-hosted code.** You may download _data_ (JSON/CSS)
   and run it through engine logic that ships **inside** the package; you may not
   download and execute JS. (`chrome.userScripts` is the only sanctioned escape
   hatch, and it's gated behind a per-user "Allow User Scripts" toggle and is
   unavailable on Safari.)
2. **The core is GPL-3.0 with many copyright holders.** It can't be relicensed or
   closed. Monetizable / proprietary plugins must therefore be **independent works**
   — and _data read by a GPL engine is not a derivative work of it._

Both constraints point at the same answer → **declarative-first** plugins.

## Two tiers

| Tier                    | Ships                       | Store-safe                     | Runs on                   | Status                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `declarative` (default) | CSS + JSON (`domOps`)       | ✅ everywhere, remote-loadable | Chrome / Firefox / Safari | **implemented**                                 |
| `scripted` (advanced)   | JS via `chrome.userScripts` | gated toggle, no Safari        | Chrome / Firefox          | reserved (gated, runtime is a future milestone) |

## Architecture

```
PluginSource[]  ──►  manifests        SiteRegistry ──► SiteAdapter (current URL)
   (native builtin,
    bundled catalog,
    remote host catalog)                   ▼
pluginState (storage) ─► enabled?    DeclarativeEngine (interprets contributions)
EntitlementProvider  ─► entitled?         │  styles + domOps, reversible, idempotent
        └──────────►  PluginHost.reconcile() ──► engine.mount/unmount
```

- **`types.ts`** — the whole contract: `PluginManifest`, `PluginContributions`,
  `DomOperation` (discriminated union — the main extension point), `SiteAdapter`,
  and the `PluginSource` / `EntitlementProvider` seams.
- **`sites/`** — `SiteAdapter` per site + a `SiteRegistry` that resolves the
  current URL. Site-specific selectors live **only** in an adapter, behind the
  fixed semantic vocabulary in `sites/semanticKeys.ts` (`userTurn`,
  `assistantTurn`, `thinkingBlock`, `codeBlock`, `composer`, `sidebar`,
  `sidePanel`, `headerActions`, `scrollContainer`), so a site redesign is a
  one-file fix. Gemini and AI Studio are native surfaces and stay TypeScript
  adapters; every plugin platform is data, so `adapters/claude.ts`,
  `adapters/chatgpt.ts` and `adapters/deepseek.ts` are one-line shells over their
  `site.json`: edit the JSON, not the TS. `sites/siteAdapterData.ts` holds
  `validateSiteAdapterData`, the one validator for the bundled `site.json`, the
  remote override and `catalog:build`.
- **`runtime/declarativeEngine.ts`** — applies a manifest's `styles` + `domOps`.
  Reversible (full teardown), idempotent, and uses a `childList`-only
  MutationObserver so its own mutations can't loop. Pure DOM → all platforms.
- **`runtime/PluginHost.ts`** — orchestrator. Loads manifests, checks
  match-URL + enabled + engine-range + entitlement, mounts/unmounts, reacts to
  state changes. All dependencies injected → fully unit-testable.
- **`manifest/validate.ts`** — turns `unknown` into a typed manifest or a list of
  issues. Remote catalog plugins are untrusted; bundled catalog plugins use
  the same validator so official data cannot drift from the runtime contract.
- **`storage/pluginState.ts`** — per-plugin enable state in `chrome.storage.local`.
- **`sources/` `entitlement/`** — the swap points for native first-party
  features, bundled official declarative plugins, the per-host remote catalog,
  and a future paid (Stripe/account) store. `sources/defaultSources.ts` also
  owns `mergePluginRecords`, the rules that pick which copy of a plugin id wins.
- **`remote/`** — the per-host remote catalog channel: a read-only source over a
  storage cache, plus a background-only fetcher. See below.
- **`catalog/`** — the bundled official data: one directory per plugin platform,
  each holding that platform's `site.json` and its declarative plugins. This
  keeps official CSS/JSON changes in the same PR, CI run, and release as engine
  or popup changes.

```
catalog/
  marketplace.json                        index for the docs plugin store
  sites/index.ts                          import.meta.glob discovery
  sites/<site>/site.json                  the site adapter, as data
  sites/<site>/plugins/<id>/plugin.json   a declarative plugin
  sites/<site>/plugins/<id>/style.css     its styles
  sites/<site>/plugins/<id>/README.md     what it fixes and why
```

`catalog/sites/index.ts` finds every `site.json` and `plugin.json` with
`import.meta.glob`, so adding a site or a plugin is adding files: there is no
mapping table. (`scripts/build-plugin-catalog.ts` reads the same tree from disk,
because `import.meta.glob` does not exist under Bun.) Sites today are `chatgpt`,
`claude` and `deepseek`. A plugin's `matches` must stay inside its site's
`matches` (plan D18) or the build fails, and `bun run catalog:build` validates
every site and plugin before publishing.

`catalog/marketplace.json` is **not** that mapping table. It is only the index
the docs plugin-store page fetches, and a test keeps it in sync with discovery,
so a new plugin also needs an entry there whose `source` is the catalog-relative
path (`sites/deepseek/plugins/reading-width/plugin.json`).

## Authoring a declarative plugin

```jsonc
{
  "id": "vendor.my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "...",
  "author": "...",
  "category": "readability",
  "license": "MIT",
  "engine": ">=1.0.0",
  "tier": "declarative",
  "matches": ["https://claude.ai/*"],
  "contributes": {
    "styles": [{ "file": "style.css" }],
    "domOps": [{ "op": "addClass", "target": "body", "className": "gv-plugin-readable" }],
  },
}
```

An official plugin is authored as files under its platform's directory:

1. Pick the site it belongs to. If that site has no `catalog/sites/<site>/`
   directory yet, write its `site.json` first (`id` equal to the directory name,
   `label`, `matches`, `selectors` keyed by the semantic vocabulary, `theme`,
   `brandColor`, `capabilities`, optional `conversationIdPattern`). Nothing
   registers it: the registry picks it up from the file.
2. Create `catalog/sites/<site>/plugins/<id>/` with `plugin.json`, `style.css`
   and a short `README.md`.
3. Keep the plugin's `matches` inside the site's `matches` (D18).
4. Add the entry to `catalog/marketplace.json` so the docs plugin store lists it.
5. Run the suite: discovery, D18 and the marketplace index are all asserted in
   `catalog/sites/index.test.ts`.

Manifests may keep tiny CSS inline with `{ "css": "..." }`, but the preferred
authoring shape is `{ "file": "style.css" }` next to `plugin.json`. The bundled
source and the published catalog file both resolve that CSS to inline text,
reject remote-resource loads (`@import`, external `url()`), and normalize it
before the runtime sees it. For
user settings, `{{settingKey}}` tokens can be used in CSS text or in
`setAttribute` / `setStyle` DOM op values; a common pattern is for CSS files to
use a normal custom property and for a `setStyle` op to set that variable from a
setting.

`target` is a CSS selector string, or `{ "kind": "semantic", "key": "userTurn" }`
to use the site adapter's stable selector for one of the nine semantic keys in
`sites/semanticKeys.ts`; a `site.json` may not invent a key outside that
vocabulary. Supported ops: `addClass`,
`setAttribute`, `setStyle`, `hide`, plus `native` (below). All are reversible.
Classes must be `gv-` prefixed (content-script rule).

## Primitives (`verbs/`) and the `native` op

Shipped primitives (`verbs/contracts.ts`): `formulaCopy` (since 1.3.0), `vimInput` (since 1.4.0,
`composer` param, defaults to the adapter's `composer` selector) and `turnNavigator` (since 1.4.0,
`turn` / `conversationIdPattern` / `scrollContainer` / `yieldWhen` / `position`, all optional and
defaulting to the adapter). The formula-copy, Vim and Claude-timeline builtins are now manifests
that invoke these primitives; the timeline engine lives in `verbs/turnNavigator/TurnNavigator.ts`.

ChatGPT uses the DOM-only `sites/adapters/chatgptTurns.ts` provider, shared with export, and
`verbs/turnNavigator/chatgptRegistry.ts` for native `cg-<messageId>` identity. Only discovered user
messages whose shells belong to the current confirmed branch are displayed. Unknown history is
not fetched; a refresh rebuilds the discovered index from the page. A retained shell can preserve
its previously discovered summary while its body is unmounted. Navigation owns a cancellable
three-second request and reports an unavailable target with a retry action. Long prompts align
their beginning near the viewport top. Compact mode hides the continuous rail background while
keeping the clickable ticks and hover preview; previews above 100 entries render a window.

Conversation generations guard delayed reads, navigation, long presses and layout callbacks.
Reading position, preview/search and pending requests are document-local. Formal conversation
stars retain their existing storage schema and synchronize through storage notifications; temporary
and unstable-ID stars stay in page memory. Temporary stars are promoted only after the current
formal conversation's DOM confirms the same native identities, or a trusted first-submission
record proves creation on an empty page with the matching draft, account route and native user
identity within ten seconds. Navigation and history traversal cancel this creation record. DOM without a reliable route
association remains hidden during a handoff rather than persisting stars under an unproven key.
Legacy `c-...` links/stars resolve only through an unambiguous hash and, for stars, compatible
stored content. Branch changes never delete stored stars.

Some behaviour cannot be expressed as CSS or as the reversible DOM operations.
A **primitive** is that behaviour, written once as first-party TypeScript inside
the extension and given a name a manifest can call:

```jsonc
{
  "engine": ">=1.3.0",
  "requires": { "handlers": ["formulaCopy"] },
  "contributes": {
    "domOps": [{ "op": "native", "handler": "formulaCopy", "params": {} }],
  },
}
```

The manifest picks a primitive and configures it. It never supplies logic: no
conditions, no ordering, no code. `params` is configuration, checked by that
primitive's own hand-written guard before the primitive sees it (plan C1, D17).
That is what keeps a remote manifest data rather than remotely-hosted code, and
it is why `native` is safe on the same channel as CSS.

Three files divide the work:

- **`verbs/contracts.ts`** — data only: every primitive's `name`, `sinceEngine`,
  the semantic keys it reads from the adapter, and its parameter spec. It
  imports no DOM and no implementation, so `scripts/build-plugin-catalog.ts`
  can read it under Bun.
- **`verbs/registry.ts`** — the implementations, keyed by name.
  `verifyPrimitiveRegistry()` asserts the two lists match, so a contract can
  never describe a primitive that does not exist and vice versa.
- **`verbs/<name>.ts`** — one primitive: its `contract`, a `validateParams`
  guard, and `activate(scope, params, context)`. Every side effect is registered
  on the `PluginScope`, so unmount pays them all back, and the primitive reports
  how many elements it acts on through `context.setTargetCounter`.

`sinceEngine` is the `PLUGIN_ENGINE_VERSION` that first shipped the primitive.
A manifest that uses a primitive must set an `engine` range whose **minimum** is
at least that version, and `bun run catalog:build` fails the build otherwise
(plan §5, §8). This ordering is the point: an older Voyager then reports
`needs-engine` ("update Voyager") instead of `needs-handler`, which is left
meaning a genuine configuration mistake. `catalog:build` also rejects a handler
with no contract, and a semantic key the plugin's own site does not define.

`requires` states the same needs declaratively:

- `requires.handlers` lists the primitives the plugin invokes. Every `native` op
  is implied, so listing it is documentation, not duplication.
- `requires.semantic` lists semantic keys the plugin depends on beyond the ones
  its ops target. A primitive's own `semantic` keys come from its contract.

`runtime/pluginStatus.ts` derives both sets (`requiredHandlers`,
`requiredSemanticKeys`) and turns them into a status, which `PluginHost` reports
for every plugin that targets the page instead of quietly filtering it:

| Kind             | Meaning                               | Popup                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `needs-engine`   | `engine` range above this build       | toggle disabled, "needs Voyager ≥ x.y" |
| `needs-handler`  | a primitive this build does not ship  | toggle disabled, "update Voyager"      |
| `needs-semantic` | the site adapter lacks a key it needs | toggle disabled, names the site        |
| `ready`          | compatible, not mounted yet           | normal toggle                          |
| `mounted`        | enabled and running on this page      | normal toggle                          |
| `no-effect`      | mounted but found nothing (D12)       | toggle stays on, yellow warning        |

`needs-permission` is not in this list: the popup owns the permission flow, and
a content script that is running already has its permission.

**Health signal (D12).** `runtime/healthMonitor.ts` answers "is this plugin
doing anything here?". It waits for the engine's `childList` observer to go
quiet, then flags a plugin only when the adapter's `userTurn` selector matches
more than zero elements **and** the plugin's own target count is zero. An empty
conversation is never flagged, a slow page is never flagged early (quiet
detection drives the timing; the deadline is only a ceiling), and a target
appearing later clears the flag. Pure-CSS plugins have no countable targets and
are never tracked.

**Update timing (D7).** A CSS or `domOps` update remounts immediately. A
primitive-backed plugin does not: the primitive may hold UI state, so the page
keeps the mounted version, the status carries `pendingVersion`, and the popup
says the update applies after a reload. A SPA `pushState` is not a reload; only
a full page load switches versions.

**Evolution (D9).** A published parameter never changes type and never becomes
required. Parameters may only be **added**, and only as **optional**. Anything
breaking ships under a new primitive name, so `handler` never needs a version
suffix. A committed baseline in `verbs/paramsBaseline.json` holds the contract
tests to this.

`formulaCopy` is the first primitive, and
`catalog/sites/deepseek/plugins/formula-copy/` is the first plugin built on one.
The native builtin `voyager.formula-copy` is unaffected and stays as it is until
P4 rewrites the Claude and ChatGPT builtins as primitive-backed JSON.

## Boundaries

- **Official CSS/JSON plugins** live in `catalog/sites/<site>/plugins/<id>/` and
  load through `BundledCatalogPluginSource`. Their site adapters live beside
  them in `catalog/sites/<site>/site.json`.
- **First-party features that need JS** live in `builtin/` and register native
  handlers in the content script. `voyager.formula-copy` is the model here.
- **Updates to those official plugins** can also reach users between releases
  through the per-host remote catalog below. Only data travels; executable code
  never does.

`sources/defaultSources.ts` defines the active sources and merge rules below.
Maintain bundled official plugins in this repository; the retired
`../voyager-plugins` marketplace is no longer a source. `bun run catalog:build`
generates the remote catalog published by the docs deploy. See the
[distribution design](../../../.github/docs/PLUGIN_DISTRIBUTION_PLAN.md).

## Remote host catalog (`remote/`)

The official CSS/JSON plugins ship as a snapshot inside the extension, and the
same data is published per site at `<base>/hosts/<host>.json` (default base
`https://voyager.nagi.fun/catalog`, so DeepSeek is
`https://voyager.nagi.fun/catalog/hosts/chat.deepseek.com.json`). A selector fix
can therefore reach users without a store release, while the engine that reads
the data still ships in the package. The host file's optional `site` section is
adapter data validated by the same `validateSiteAdapterData`, and it overrides
the bundled adapter for that host, so a `site.json` fix travels the same way a
plugin fix does.

- **`remote/HostCatalogSource.ts`** — a read-only `PluginSource`
  (`kind: 'remote'`). `list({ host })` serves whatever the cache holds for that
  host and never touches the network, so page loads, popup opens and
  catalog-change reloads all stay local. It is authoritative for a host only
  when the cached entry is a successful fetch written by the running extension
  version.
- **`remote/hostCatalogRefresh.ts`** — the only network writer, and it runs in
  the background only. Single flight per host, so concurrent tabs share one
  pass. Gates in order: the build flag; the host shape (plain hostnames, no
  wildcards or ports); the user settings (online-updates switch, check interval
  counted from the last attempt, failure backoff, writer-version staleness); and
  page eligibility, meaning at least one **enabled** plugin targets the host.
  Gemini and AI Studio have no plugins, so they never pass the last gate and
  never produce a request. A manual check sends `force` and skips every gate
  except the build flag.
- **`remote/hostCatalogPolicy.ts`** — the pure rules the background and the
  content script must agree on (which hosts may be looked up, when a check is
  due, the backoff curve, when a cached entry may be used at all), each one
  directly testable without storage or network.
- **`remote/hostCatalogCache.ts`** — one entry per host under
  `StorageKeys.PLUGIN_HOST_CATALOG_PREFIX`, i.e. `gvPluginHostCatalog:<host>` in
  `chrome.storage.local`. Readers subscribe to **content** changes only:
  recording a failed or byte-identical attempt must not remount plugin CSS or
  feed back into another refresh.
- **`remote/hostCatalogFile.ts`** — validates the published file (`format: 1`,
  matching `host`, a plugin array, an optional `site` section), which
  `scripts/build-plugin-catalog.ts` generates from `catalog/` with the CSS
  inlined. Every entry passes the same `validateManifest` as the bundled
  snapshot and the `site` section the same `validateSiteAdapterData`; a bad
  entry or a bad `site` is skipped and logged, a bad file is discarded whole.
- **`remote/config.ts`** — build-time flags injected through Vite `define`:
  `VOYAGER_PLUGIN_CATALOG_URL` repoints the base URL (https only) for a preview
  environment, and `VOYAGER_PLUGIN_CATALOG_REMOTE=off` compiles a build that
  never contacts the catalog host, leaving the bundled snapshot as the only
  source. The second flag is the store-review fallback.

**Settings** live in `chrome.storage.sync` and are covered by
`SettingsBackupService`: `gvPluginOnlineUpdatesEnabled` (master switch, on by
default) and `gvPluginCatalogCheckInterval` (`1h` / `6h` / `24h` / `manual`,
default `6h`). The popup surfaces both on plugin sites, plus a manual check that
works even when the switch is off.

**Message**: a content script or the popup sends `gv.pluginCatalog.refresh`
(`PLUGIN_CATALOG_REFRESH_MESSAGE` in `runtime/messages.ts`) with
`{ host, force }`. The background decides and writes the cache entry; nothing
else fetches.

**Merge rules** — `mergePluginRecords` in `sources/defaultSources.ts`, per
plugin id:

- builtin ids always come from `builtin/`; a remote entry with the same id is
  ignored, so first-party scope and settings can never be rewritten remotely;
- a remote entry whose `engine` range this build satisfies replaces the bundled
  copy;
- if the remote entry needs a newer engine, the bundled copy stays and carries
  `blockedUpdate`, which the popup renders as "needs a newer Voyager" (when
  neither copy is compatible the remote one is listed and the status machine
  reports needs-engine);
- when the remote catalog is authoritative for the host, a bundled plugin that
  targets the page and is absent from the catalog is dropped: the kill switch;
- a 404, a failed fetch, or an entry written by a different extension version
  contributes nothing, so the bundled snapshot stays in force until the next
  successful fetch.

## What is NOT done yet (next milestones)

- **A remote-only NEW site.** The catalog updates plugins _and_ adapter data for
  hosts the extension already knows, but the file is fetched per host, and host
  permissions plus content-script registration still ship in the package. Adding
  a site is still an extension release.
- **Full setting UI coverage.** The schema accepts boolean/string/color/select;
  the popup currently renders boolean switches and number/range controls, while
  string, color and select controls remain future work.
- **Scripted runtime** via gated `chrome.userScripts`.
- **Account + Stripe entitlement**.

## Platform notes

- **Safari**: declarative only (no `userScripts`, App Store review). Cross-site
  dynamic registration is limited — keep Safari on manifest-declared sites.
- **Firefox**: declarative works; `userScripts` exists but differs; AMO review
  forbids remote code (declarative is the safe path).
- **Chrome/Edge**: full support, including the future gated `scripted` tier.
