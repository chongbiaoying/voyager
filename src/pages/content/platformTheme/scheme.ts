/**
 * Light/dark for ALL Voyager UI, resolved once per page instead of re-derived
 * per surface.
 *
 * Every host site announces dark mode in its own dialect — Gemini with
 * `.theme-host.dark-theme`, AI Studio with `body.dark-theme`, ChatGPT and
 * Claude with `html.dark`, DeepSeek with `body.dark`. Those selectors already
 * live in each `site.json` as `SiteThemeDescriptor`; nothing used to read them,
 * so `contentStyle.css` named the dialects it happened to know and DeepSeek —
 * added later — matched none of them, leaving every Voyager surface light on a
 * dark page.
 *
 * This module is the single translator: it reads the descriptor and stamps
 * `data-gv-scheme="light" | "dark"` on the document root. CSS keys off that one
 * attribute, and JS reads `getScheme()` / `subscribeScheme()` instead of
 * re-implementing the check. Adding a platform is then one line of `site.json`.
 *
 * An attribute rather than a class: it carries a value, so a module can read
 * `documentElement.dataset.gvScheme` synchronously without importing anything,
 * and it matches the `data-gv-theme` naming the Prompt Manager already uses.
